# Alien-Invasion-2D-Game-Using-Python-and-Pygame
Implemented a 2D interactive game called Alien Invasion using Python and the Pygame library as part of my game development learning. The project involved designing a visually responsive game window, rendering a controllable spaceship, and handling user input events like key presses and window interactions. Implemented object-oriented programming principles to manage game components such as the ship, settings, and display loop. Scaled and positioned graphical assets, handled real-time events with a game loop, and structured the project with clean and reusable code.
